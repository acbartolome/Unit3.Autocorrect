# Workshop - Autocorrect
In this workshop, you will be writing higher order functions to implement a basic autocorrect algorithm. The key concepts behind this algorithm are relevance and distance. Given a string to correct, we first choose relevant strings from a larger set, and then of that subset, we select the closest option.
